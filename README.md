<h1>Drunk Cupcakes</h1>

* Drunk Cupcakes is a fun little tool that will convert your favorite cocktail into a cupcake recipe. I came up with the idea after my cohort kept requesting my drunk cupcake formula. Now I am sharing a version of that with everyone!


* A user can use a search form that either queries from the database, or runs a query from The Cocktail Database api. Once they select a drink, it will take them to a the recipe of that beverage. If a user is signed in or creates an account they will be able to save that recipe to a user profile.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

* Adding the ability for a user to give a review on a cupcake recipe

* Creating a way for a user to submit their own cupcake creations, or create a copy to update from the database.
